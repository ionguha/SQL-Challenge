# SQL-Challenge
## Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. I was given the assignment to (a) Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs (b) Import the CSV files into a SQL database and (c) Write SQL queries to gain insight from the data. The repository is designed as following: 
 * All the queries and results can be found in the directory **_EmployeeSQL_**
 * Subdirectory **_Data Modeling_** contains the ER diagrams obtained from QuickDBD & Lucidchart
 * Subdirectory **_Data Engineering_** contains the schema used to design the tables & import CSV files
 * Subdirectory **_Data Analysis_** contains the two .sql files used to analyze the data (**_Queries.sql_** and **_Additional_queries.sql_**
 * Subdirectory **_Images_** contain the output image files from the SQL queries as well as Visualization files from the Jupyter notebook 
 * Jupyter notebook **_SQLAlchemy_visualization_** was used to create visualizations from the database
 * A report of the study is available as **_Pewlett Hackard Report.pdf_**
